Just a chill Arch Linux user. Likes to cave in his room and tweak his Hyprland configs. Sometimes doing a big Java/C++ project, or just writing some CLI utilities in Go (currently learning).
## Official Linux Guru
Taught a person how to install both Debian-based and Arch distros, as well as teaching the filesystem and basic skills required to operate a Linux distro.

*Of course, when I say Linux, I am referring to GNU/Linux, or as it started being called recently, GNU+Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself...*
